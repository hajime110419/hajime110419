I'm a middle school student from Japan with a passion for technology, science, and the art of communication. My main tools are **Python** and **Linux**, which I use to explore everything from open-source software to IoT.

My core drive is a deep curiosity about how things work—whether it's a Linux kernel, a radio wave, or a piece of finely engineered stationery. I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems and am always eager to learn something new.

## ✨ Key Achievements & Experiences

Here are some of the projects and activities I'm proud of:

*   🌐 **Open Source Contributor:** Contributed to the Japanese translation for **KDE's "End of 10" initiative**, helping to make important information more accessible.
*   📺 **TV Appearance:** Featured on TV Asahi's popular program **"Hakase-chan" (博士ちゃん)** as a stationery expert, where I shared my passion for the design and engineering of stationery.
*   🔬 **Science Koshien Winner:** Awarded **2nd place (as a 1st-year) and 3rd place (as a 2nd-year)** in the prefectural **Science Koshien Junior (科学の甲子園ジュニア)**.
*   📻 **Licensed Amateur Radio Operator:** Hold a 4th-class amateur radio license in Japan, which fuels my interest in hardware and IoT communication.

## 👨‍💻 What I'm Focused On

*   🌱 **Learning:** I'm currently diving deeper into network protocols, IoT development with Raspberry Pi, and container technologies like Docker.
*   🔭 **Exploring:** Actively exploring system administration and how to build efficient, secure server environments.
*   👯 **Collaborating:** I'm looking for opportunities to contribute to open-source projects that align with my interests.
