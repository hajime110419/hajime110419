I'm a middle school student from Japan, driven by a multifaceted passion that spans from the depths of Linux and Open Source Software to becoming a subject-matter expert in unique fields.

My journey is fueled by a relentless curiosity to understand how things work, whether it's compiling a kernel or deconstructing the mechanism of a fountain pen. I believe in the power of sharing knowledge, both through code and communication.

## 🏆 Achievements & Contributions

I'm proud of my contributions in both the technical and non-technical worlds:

*   **Open Source Contributor:** Served as an official Japanese translator for **[KDE's "End of Windows 10" awareness campaign](https://endof10.org/ja/)**. I helped make important information accessible to the Japanese-speaking community.
*   **TV Appearance:** I was featured on the national Japanese TV program "**博士ちゃん**" (Hakase-chan / Little Professor) by TV Asahi, where I was recognized as a "**Stationery Expert**" for my deep knowledge in the field.

## 🛠️ Core Skills: Python & Linux

My primary tools for building and exploring are Python and the Linux environment.
